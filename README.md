# AB-Analysis

For this project I was given three ad choices. From those I needed to decided which two would be the best to compare using an A/B statistical test. After data cleaning, data visualizations, and statistical testing, I was able to derive several insights to advise the marketing team on which ad to commit to in order to increase revenue for their product.
