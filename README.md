# AB-Analysis

For this project I was given three ad choices to determine which would have the highest ROI for customer retention. From those I narrowed down my choices to the two that perform the best and best suite customer needs. After data cleaning, data visualizations, and statistical testing, I was able to derive several insights through A/B testing in Python to advise the marketing team on which ad to choose in order to gain the most revenue possible.
